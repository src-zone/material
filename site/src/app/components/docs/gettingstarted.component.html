<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>This guide gets you started with Blox Material in new or existing projects
  created with the <a href="https://cli.angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular CLI</a>.
  The Angular CLI only works with Node installed. So if you don't already
  have a recent Node version running, please refer to
  <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">Node Downloads</a>
  for instructions to install Node and Npm on your computer.
  To install (or upgrade to) the latest Angular CLI, run:
</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code highlightJs lang="bash">npm install -g @angular/cli</code></pre>
</div>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
  Check that you are using recent versions of Angular CLI, Node, and Npm:
  run <code>ng version &amp;&amp; npm -v &amp;&amp; node -v</code> to
  check your versions.
  This guide was written using Angular CLI 9.0.7, Npm 6.13.4, and Node 12.16.1.
</blockquote>

<h2>Step 1: Prepare your Angular Project</h2>
<p>Although not required, using <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a>
  is highly recommended with Blox Material projects.
  The Material styling/themes are much easier to customize with Sass.
  For new projects, use Angular CLI to bootstrap the project, and make scss (Sass) the default stylesheet
  preprocessor:</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code highlightJs lang="bash">ng new NAME-OF-PROJECT --style=scss
cd NAME-OF-PROJECT</code></pre>
</div>
<p>For existing projects that do not use Sass yet, you can switch to Sass as default stylesheet preprocessor
  with the following command (run inside the root directory of your project):</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code highlightJs lang="bash">ng config schematics.@schematics/angular:component.styleext scss</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Then simply rename <code>src/styles.css</code> to <code>src/styles.scss</code>,
  and in the configuration file <code>angular.json</code> also change the reference
  to <code>styles.css</code> to refer to <code>styles.scss</code> instead.
  (You can find that under projects/<wbr>NAME-OF-PROJECT/<wbr>architect/<wbr>build/<wbr>options/<wbr>styles
  in the file).
  Since scss is an extension of css, this will not affect your existing styles.
</p>
<p>For existing projects, also make sure that you are using at least Angular CLI 9
  (Angular CLI uses the version installed for your project, not the globally installed
  version). This can be checked by running <code>ng version</code> in the project directory.
  If the project uses an older Angular CLI version, upgrade it by running
  <code>npm install --save-dev @angular/cli</code> in your project directory.
</p>

<h2>Step 2: Install Blox Material</h2>
<p>Now add the Blox Material library to your project:</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code highlightJs lang="bash">npm install --save @blox/material</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Next install <code>@angular/forms</code> (optional):</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code highlightJs lang="bash">npm install --save @angular/forms</code></pre>
</div>
<p>And add the Material module to your application (in <code>src/app/app.module.ts</code>):</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code highlightJs lang="typescript">import {{'{ FormsModule }'}} from '@angular/forms'; // (optional)
import {{'{ MaterialModule }'}} from '@blox/material';

@NgModule({{'{'}}
    ...
    imports: [
        BrowserModule,
        FormsModule,      // using FormsModule is optional
        MaterialModule,
        ...
    ],
    ...
{{'}'}})
export class MyAppModule {{'{ }'}}</code></pre>
</div>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
  Blox Material is designed in such a way that only components, directives, and services that
  are used in your application end up in the final production build.
  (The code is effectively <em>tree-shakeable</em> by the Angular CLI, and other build tools like Webpack and
  Rollup).
  Thus there is no need for smaller partial modules for separate components, like other Angular frameworks
  typically offer.
  Just import the complete <code>MaterialModule</code>, only functionality that is actually used
  is going to your customers!
</blockquote>
<p>
  The example also includes the <code>@angular/forms FormsModule</code>. Using the FormsModule
  is <strong>not</strong> a requirement of Blox Material. All Blox Material components can also be used
  without the FormsModule. However, the FormsModule makes building forms a brease, with easy
  binding of controls to data, addition of validation rules, display of errors, and much more.
  Please refer to <a href="https://angular.io/guide/forms" target="_blank">Angular Forms Guide</a>
  for more in depth information.</p>
<blockquote>
  Blox Material is fully compatible with <code>@angular/forms</code>, and supports both the
  <code>FormsModule</code>, and the
  <code><a href="https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms" target="_blank">ReactiveFormsModule</a></code>.
  But all Blox Material features can also be used without the <code>@angular/forms</code>
  package.
</blockquote>

<h2>Step 3: Import and Customize a Theme</h2>
<p>To tell the Sass preprocessor how to find all Material Components theme files,
  add the following configuration to the build <code>options</code> section of your
  project in the <code>angular.json</code> file (under
  projects/<wbr>NAME-OF-PROJECT/<wbr>architect/<wbr>build/<wbr>options:</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code highlightJs lang="json">{{'{'}}
    "projects": {{'{ "NAME-OF-PROJECT": { "architect": { "build": {'}}
        ...
        "options": {{'{'}}
            ...
            "styles": ...
            ...
            "stylePreprocessorOptions": {{'{'}}
                "includePaths": [
                    "node_modules"
                ]
            {{'}'}},
            ...
        {{'}'}}
    {{'\}\}\}\}'}}
    ...
{{'}'}}</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Next, add the following code to your <code>src/styles.scss</code> file:</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code highlightJs lang="scss">// customize some theme variables, e.g.:
$mdc-theme-primary: #6200ee;
$mdc-theme-secondary: #018786;
$mdc-theme-background: #fff;

// import theming for all mdc components:
@import "material-components-web/material-components-web";</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
  This will add theme styles for all available Material components. If you only use
  a couple of components, you can save memory by only including the theme files
  for the components you actually use. For example:</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code highlightJs lang="scss">@import &quot;@material/button/mdc-button&quot;;
@import &quot;@material/card/mdc-fab&quot;;</code></pre>
</div>
<p>To use Google's Material Icons, and the Roboto font (default font for the Material Components),
  you may also want to add the following stylesheets to the head section of the <code>src/index.html</code>
  file (both are optional):
</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code highlightJs lang="html">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto">
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>
  For more information about customizing and extending the theme, see
  <a href="https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/blob/master/packages/mdc-theme/README.md"
    target="_blank">Material Components Web Theme Documentation</a>.
  Most components also define Sass variables and/or mixins to further customize their appearance.
  Links to the documentation for these Sass rules can be found on the component's documentation page.
</p>

<h2>Step 4: Use Material Components!</h2>
<p>Open <code>src/app/app.component.html</code> and add some markup, for example:</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code highlightJs lang="html">&lt;button mdcButton raised>My First Material Button&lt;/button></code></pre>
</div>
<p>Next, run <code>npm run start</code> and when the application starts, navigate to <code>http://localhost:4200</code>.
  Validate you see the added button, and that it is correctly styled.
  Congratulations! You have made your first Angular App with Blox Material!
  The <a [routerLink]="['/components']">Components</a> section of this website contains documentation and
  code samples for all supported Material components.
  You can even experiment with the demos by editing the source code without leaving your browser!

<blockquote class="blox-content-last">
  If you have to support Internet Explorer, a few extra steps are required.
  Luckily we wrote a guide to help you with that as well:
