<h1>Building for IE11</h1>
<p>When targeting Internet Explorer 11 in a Blox Material application
  built with Angular CLI there are two issues:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Angular CLI by default targets modern evergreen browsers. IE11 is not that modern anymore.</li>
  <li>Material Web Components are distributed as ES6 javascript. IE11 only supports ES5 javascript.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Luckily since Angular CLI 9 it has become a lot easier to configure your angular app for IE11.
  However this will only work for (production) builds. The <code>ng serve</code> command does not
  offer a configuration options to transpile library dependencies to ES5 on demand. Since
  the material-web-components library is currently only distributed in ES6 javascript,
  <code>ng serve</code> will not work for IE11.
</p>
<p>
  For (production) builds, supporting IE11 is made super easy though, with the default
  differential loading that Angular CLI supports.
</p>

<h2>Step 1: Edit browserslist</h2>
<p>
  Angular CLI has created a file <code>browserslist</code> in the root directory of your project.
  Just make sure that the list of supported browsers includes IE:
</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code highlightJs>...
last 2 versions
not dead
IE 11
...</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
  Now when you run <code>ng serve</code>, the generated application will contain
  javascript for both es2015 and es5 browsers. The html is generated so that
  browsers will only load the versions they need (and support).
</p>

<h2>Step 2: Edit polyfills.ts</h2>
<p>
  Angular CLI has created a file polyfills.ts in the src directory of your project.
  For classlist support on SVG, you will have to uncomment the line that imports
  <code>classlist.js</code>. The result will look like:
</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code highlightJs lang="typescript">...
/** IE10 and IE11 requires the following for NgClass support on SVG elements */
import 'classlist.js';  // Run 'npm install --save classlist.js'.
...</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
  Also, as instructed for the <code>classlist.js</code> polyfill, run:
</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code highlightJs lang="bash">npm install --save classlist.js</code></pre>
</div>

<p class="blox-content-last">
  Congratulations! You now have your Angular application fully integrated with Blox Material, optimized and working for
  any browser supported by Angular.
  Now head to the <a [routerLink]="['/components']">components documentation</a> for code samples and instructions on
  how to use all Material components in your app!
