<h1>Menu Surface</h1>
<p>Menu Surfaces (`mdcMenuSurface`) are reusable surfaces that appear above the content of the page
  when in view. They can be positioned adjacent to an element that triggers the activation (e.g. the
  provided `mdcMenuAnchor` directive).</p>
<p>Menu Surfaces are used by <a routerLink="../menu">mdcMenu</a>, and
  <a routerLink="../select">mdcSelectMenu</a>. But they can also be used
  on their own.</p>
