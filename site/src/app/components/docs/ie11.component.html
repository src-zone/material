<h1>Building for IE11</h1>
<p>When targeting Internet Explorer 11 in a Blox Material application
  built with Angular CLI there are two issues:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Angular CLI by default targets modern evergreen browsers. IE11 is not that modern anymore.</li>
  <li>Material Web Components are distributed as ES6 javascript. IE11 only supports ES5 javascript.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Luckily both issues can be solved relatively easy.
</p>

<h2>Step 1: Adding polyfills for IE11</h2>
<p>
  The Angular CLI has created a file <code>polyfills.ts</code> in the <code>src</code> directory of your project.
  That file contains all the code required to help IE11 with executing some javascript functions that it does
  not support natively.
  These lines are just commented out.
  So to support Internet Explorer, remove the comments from the lines that are indicated as required for IE11.
  The result will look like:
</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="tsPolyfills" [language]="'typescript'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>
  Also, as instructed for the <code>classlist.js</code> polyfill, run:
</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="'npm install --save classlist.js'" [language]="'bash'"></code></pre>
</div>

<h2>Step 2: Transpiling generated Javascript bundles</h2>
<blockquote>
  This step is only for Angular CLI projects. If you build your Angular app with Webpack or
  Rollup a better approach is to configure the build to only transpile the <code>@material/*</code>
  packages. Have a look at the
  <a href="https://github.com/src-zone/material/blob/master/site/webpack.config.js">webpack.config.js</a>
  file of this demo website for inspiration (search for babelLoader in the file).
</blockquote>
<p>
  Add the <code>ng-utils</code> package as developer dependency to your project:
</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="'npm install --save-dev @blox/ng-utils'" [language]="'bash'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>
  Now open your <code>package.json</code> and edit the scripts section to customize the <code>start</code>
  and <code>build</code> scripts, and add a <code>transpile</code> script:
</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="pkgTasks" [language]="'json'"></code></pre>
</div>

<p>From now on make sure to always use the following command to create a production distribution of your
  application (instead of <code>ng build --prod</code>):</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code mwlHighlightJs [source]="'npm run build'" [language]="'bash'"></code></pre>
</div>
<p>
  Congratulations! You now have your Angular application fully integrated with Blox Material, optimized and working for
  any browser supported by Angular.
  Now head to the <a [routerLink]="['/components']">components documentation</a> for code samples and instructions on
  how to use all Material components in your app!
