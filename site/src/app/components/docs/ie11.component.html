<h1>Building for IE11</h1>
<p>When targeting Internet Explorer 11 in a Blox Material application
  built with Angular CLI there are two issues:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Angular CLI by default targets modern evergreen browsers. IE11 is not that modern anymore.</li>
  <li>Material Web Components are distributed as ES6 javascript. IE11 only supports ES5 javascript.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Luckily with only a few tweaks, it's possible to also support IE11!
</p>

<h2>Step 1: Edit browserslist</h2>
<p>
  Angular CLI has created a file <code>.browserslistrc</code> in the root directory of your project.
  Just make sure that the list of supported browsers includes IE:
</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code highlightJs>last 1 Chrome version
...
IE 11
...</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
  Now when you run <code>ng build</code>, the generated application will contain
  javascript for both es2015 and es5 browsers. The angular CLI just creates an
  extra bundle by transpiling the es2015 code to es5 javascript. The html is generated
  so that browsers will only load the versions they need (and support).
  This is called <em>Differential Loading</em>. For more information check out:
  <a href="https://angular.io/guide/deployment#differential-loading"
  target="_blank">https://angular.io/guide/deployment#differential-loading</a>
</p>

<h2>Step 2: Edit polyfills.ts</h2>
<p>
  Angular CLI has created a file polyfills.ts in the src directory of your project.
  For classlist support on SVG, you will have to uncomment the line that imports
  <code>classlist.js</code>. The result will look like:
</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code highlightJs lang="typescript">...
/** IE11 requires the following for NgClass support on SVG elements */
import 'classlist.js';  // Run 'npm install --save classlist.js'.
...</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
  Also, as instructed for the <code>classlist.js</code> polyfill, run:
</p>
<div class="blox-code-sample">
  <pre><code highlightJs lang="bash">npm install --save classlist.js</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
  Congratulations! You now have your Angular application fully integrated with Blox Material, optimized and working for
  any browser supported by Angular.
  Now head to the <a [routerLink]="['/components']">components documentation</a> for code samples and instructions on
  how to use all Material components in your app!

  The steps in this guide help in creating a production build of your application
  that is compatible with IE11. Local development (by executing <code>ng serve</code>)
  will still not work with IE11, since it doesn't use <code>differential loading</code>.
